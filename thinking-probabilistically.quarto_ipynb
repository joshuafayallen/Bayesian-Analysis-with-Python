        "A natural choice for our prior is the the beta distrbitution. It is bounded between 0 and 1 which helps in our coin flip problem but is especially helpful for proportions. We would have to play with our shape parameters a bit but. A mostly symetric shape around .5 makes the most sense a priori. We are not going to entirely rule out a biased coin in any direction but we feel pretty confident that over like 20 trials the proportion of heads is going to be closer to .5 than it is 1 or 0. The big benefit computationally is that the Beta distribution and the binomial are that it returns a posterior that is the same functional form of the prior making it easier to explore the posterior. This was a much bigger deal in olden times.^[By olden times we are really talking closer to like your childhood.]\n",

        "As a Bayesian we do want the data to speak for itself. But we don't have to pretend like we don't know anything about the data. We really want to shoot for weakly informative priors. We know that a player or an offense generating close to 1 EPA/play is next to impossible in the NFL. Like it could theoretically happen but that would likely require us to take a top 5 offense in the NFL in the past 5-10 years and transport it back to when players were moonlighting in the offseason. However, we are probably not likely to see that or would not be a fun excercise to undertake. Instead we can impose some weakly informative priors to encourage our models to explore a reasonable set of bounds of the posterior distribution. \n",

        "\n",
        "One helpful way we can start to do prior tuning is using `preliz`. In some respects we could theoretically just hand derive it but that is not a good use of our time. In the plot below we are just saying 90% of values should be between 0.1 and 0.7. This will then spit out the priors in the legend. We can then take this prior and feed it over to our modeling packages which is super nice. Since sometimes hand deriving logit priors and beta priors is supertedious. \n"
